Here are some python scripts used to check the VASP input/output files: INCAR, POSCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS, OSZICAR, OUTCAR, EIGENVAL, DOSCAR, and so on.

- `check_input.py`: check INCAR, POSCAR, POTCAR, and KPOINTS to see each setup is correct.

- `check_output.py`: check OUTCAR to see if a relaxation or scf calculation is converged.

- `to be continued`: more scripts are yet to come ...
